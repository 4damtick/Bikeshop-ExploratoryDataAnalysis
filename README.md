# Bikeshop Exploratory Data Analysis
## Executive Summary of this Business Case
Our bicycle company are experiencing a stagnant growth due to inefficient and uneffective marketing. We wanted to help this by exploring our visitors data to learn more about customers characteristics that may have higher propensity to buy a bike. Therefore, using Python, I analyzes the datasets to create heuristic concept of our customer.

## Project Personal Purpose & Reasons on why I chose this datasets.
During my bachelor I had a hard time on applying all the abstract theoritical concepts from my notebook. I felt I wasted so many time studying but I never apply anything in the real world.
As I am doing my master currently in business analytics, I feel projects is a way on applying insantly what we learned in the programme that helps me creates strong foundation and immerse more on the materials.
Therefore, in this project I will demonstrate a **Exploratory Data Analaysis** to improve managerial decision making.

The reason why I chose this datasets is since I am living in the Netherlands currently, everyone bike here. Whether you are old or young, married or single, no matter your ethnicity and race you are kinda controlled by this invisible hand to get around with a bicycle. This sparks an interest of me to explore any characteristics correlation.

## Goal
To learn customer behaviour based on their characteristics to see who have higher propensity to buy a bike that may help the business understand the customer more such as marketing departments on target marketing on customer that has higher propensity to buy, creating ads that targeted into that specific customer group.

## Results, Business Recommendation, Caveats.
Starting with our continuous variables that have a notable correlation with the purchased bike shows that *Children, Car* and *Age* has a negative correlation with propensity of buying bicycle. This can indicate people who are having more children are more likely to use a car as it is more easier for them. Car variable on the other hand might shows people who have car are less likely to buy a bicycle as car is more convenient for their mobility purposes. Lastly, Age negative association is logical as people who are older has lower physical capabilities to bike. In our categorical variables, we can see that *Education, Commute* and *Region* has a notable Cramers'V values with respect to the willingness of buying a bicycle that implies a strong relationship between categorical variables and our dependent variables. Education may due to educated people are more likely to be aware of the positive environmental impact of biking compared to car, thus, driving up this reationship. Commute might due to people who are likely need to travel far to the office are less likely to bike. Lastly, region of where our customers might drive up the willingness to bike with reason such as the cycling infrastructure, the awareness of the society, and many more region factors. Looking the problem from a business perspective, we know understand more of the characteristics people who have a higher willingness to buy this item such as, a higher education level, lower commute range to work, small amount of childrens, does not have a car, young age, and live in Europe region.

Therefore, from understanding this customer characteristics, we can do a lot of things for our event campaign. For example, we can partner up with business to supply them bikes for their employees who live closer. We can offer big discount for students, and many more. The caveats however, we dont know how worth it is as people that have a higher propensity to buy might still buy with or without the discount, while people who are not in this characteristics may benefit more, and therefore it is more beneficial to target them instead. This is a field where not discussed, however, this analysis can be implemented in that way with using tools from causal inferences, such as directed acyclic graph, or any other tools that can used to isolate the effect of this characteristics to its propensity of buying a bike.
